An attempt to create a transformer in C# - this is unfinished but will be added to periodically as I learn more about it!

C# implementations of this is tough as Tensorflow.NET seems to be missing some things and my attempts at getting around that are falling a bit flat.

Currently this has issues with tensor sizes not matching in the masking section and I am sure a host of other issues, am sure I will get there in the end!
